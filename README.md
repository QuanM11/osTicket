 <h2>What I learned doing this lab</h2>
 <br />
This lab presented a significant challenge primarily due to the need to configure osTicket from the ground up, with minimal prior exposure. It took several days to properly configure the system settings, email piping, and automation rules. However, creating end-user and helpdesk profiles and assigning appropriate access permissions became straightforward with continued practice. Overall, the lab provided valuable hands-on experience in virtual machine deployment and ticket lifecycle management.
